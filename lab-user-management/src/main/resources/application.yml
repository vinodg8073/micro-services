### Read configs from SCCS  
  config:                                                   # reads based on application.name and profile.active
    import: "optional:configserver:http://localhost:8091/"  # here "optional:" tells SB that if not able to connect to CS still starts the app.. & "configserver" is just indication that we're connecting to Confg server
  profiles:
    active: "prod"  # or pass from external config

# MQ connection same for other microservices. By default it has below values no need to configure   
#  rabbitmq:
#    host: "localhost"
#    port: 5672
#    username: "guest"
#    password: "guest"

### Read configs from Spring profiles           
#  config:                    # commented out to use SCCS to read the configurations
#    import:
#    - "application_qa.yml"
#    - "application_prod.yml"

#  profiles:     #Disadvantage : activates list of profile but is hardcoded (need to  generate the docker image for each environment). therefore pass external configuration (cli arguments) to activate  the profile
#    active:     # Example args using cli, jvm, env variables 
#    - "qa"      # cli (more preceding/priority) => java -jar xxx.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod || jvm => java -Dspring.profiles.active=prod -jar xxx.jar || env:SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod; java -jar xxx.jar
